    <h2 class="text-center fw-bolder " style="color:#4f1a52;">What are the Medicare Part G Plans ?</h2>
    <p class="text-center">Medicare Plan G is among ten Medicare supplement plans by filling Original Medicare coverage gaps. As a result, many seniors select Plan G to give them lots of financial help while they are enrolled in Medicare. <br> 
    Original Medicare (Parts A and B) covers a broad array of services, including hospitalization and doctor's visits. However, the expense of deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments might still be too expensive. Medigap insurance, often referred to as Medicare Supplement plans, helps to bridge these coverage gaps while also offering extra services. Except for Medigap Plan F, Medicare Supplement Plan G provides a broader range of covers than the other Medigap plans.

                What are the Medicare Part G Plans ?
                </h2>
                <!-- End meta top -->

                <class class="content">
                  <p>
                  Medicare Plan G is a Medigap supplement health insurance plan accessible to people who are disabled or over the age of 65 and are enrolled in Medicare. Plan G is a supplement policy, which means it isn't your primary coverage but fills several holes in a Medicare policy.
                  </p>
        
                  <p>
                  Part A or Part B coverage would cover the cost of necessary health care services. After those benefits have been spent, Plan G covers the remaining costs.

                  </p>

                  <p>
                  Medicare Plan G also pays for part of the costs associated with your Medicare coverage. Medicare Part A, for instance, has a deductible of up to $1,408. If you do not have any Plan G, you will have to pay the deductible out of pocket. However, if you have Plan G cover, your health insurance company will pay the whole deductible.
                  </p>
<h2 class="text-center  fw-bolder " style="color:#4f1a52;">Cost of Medicare Supplement Plan G?</h2>
                  <p>
                  Plan F is the most expensive Medigap policy available. It fills the gaps in Medicare. Plan G's insurance is nearly as impressive, with one exception: the Plan B deductible, which is up to $233 in 2022. Also after paying the Part B deductible, many Medicare enrollees consider medicare Plan G to be more cost-effective than Plan F when their rates are compared.The cost of Plan G premiums varies greatly depending on the area. Many states also charge different rates depending on your gender as well as whether you smoke or vape etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>Except for the Part B deductible, Plan G fully covers everything Medicare Parts A and B coverage. This implies that just after paying the deductible, you will not have to pay anything out of pocket for covered services and procedures.
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, a lot of factors that affect the rate increases for your Medicare Supplement plan. This covers your age at the time of enrollment as well as the pricing policy employed by your Medicare Supplement plan at the time of enrollment. The average Medicare Supplement Plan G rate increase might range between 2% and 6% per year.
                  </p>
             
                  <h2 class="text-center  fw-bolder" style="color:#4f1a52;">Best Time to Enroll in Medicare Supplement Plan G?</h2>
                  <p>
                  Medigap Plan G is available if you enroll in Medicare Parts A and B. Nevertheless, whether your pre-existing health conditions impact enrollment is determined by it when you join Medicare Supplement Plan G.
                  </p>  

                  <p>
                  Suppose you enroll in Medigap Plan G during your Open Enrollment Period as a new Medicare beneficiary or if you qualified for a Special Enrollment Period. Your pre-existing conditions will not prevent you from enrolling in this circumstance. State regulations may also enable you to register at other times, so it's crucial to know what your state allows.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  If you apply outside certain enrollment periods, you will be obliged to answer underwriting medical questions to establish your insurance policy.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  If you already have a Medicare Advantage and want to enroll in Medicare Supplement Plan G, you must first move back to Original Medicare. You can make these changes each year by taking advantage of the Open Enrollment Period in the fall or the Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period in the first quarter.
                  </p>
