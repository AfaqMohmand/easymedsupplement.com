    <h2 class="text-center fw-bolder " style="color:#4f1a52;">What are the Medicare Part L Plans ?</h2>
    <p class="text-center">Medicare Supplement Plan L has been one of two Medicare supplement (Medigap) plans with an annual out-of-pocket maximum. Plan K is the other option. <br>After you satisfy your annual Part B deductible and your out-of-pocket yearly limit for policies with an out-of-pocket limit, the plan pays for 100 percent of covered services for the remaining part of the year. Plan L is a Medigap plan which helps pay medical costs not covered by basic Medicare. Putting yearly limitations on the total of money you would spend out-of-pocket is one of its advantages, which is given by only one other Medigap coverage.</p>

    <p class="text-center">Additionally, These Medicare Supplement Insurance Plan L policies may have lower premiums than the more extensive Medicare Supplement insurance plans, including such Medigap Plan G, due to the higher level of cost-sharing. Medigap Plan L provides the fundamental benefits that all Medigap plans are allowed to provide, but only partially covers specific costs.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center fw-bolder " style="color:#4f1a52;">What Is the Primary Difference Between Medicare Plans L and K?</h2>
        <p class="text-center">The most important difference between Medigap Plans K and L is that Plan L pays a much higher proportion of insured costs and has a smaller out-of-pocket limit than Plan K. All plans are comparable in that they'll be the only two Medigap policies that do not cover all approved out-of-pocket payments. Moreover, Plan L provides slightly more coverage and usually has a higher monthly payment than Medigap Plan K. It is probably better suited for someone with mild health issues who live in states where excess charges are prohibited. </p>

Several companies may establish age-based premiums, whilst others may establish a standard rate that is unrelated to age.
