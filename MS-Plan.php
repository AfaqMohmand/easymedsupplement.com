    <p class="text-center">MMedigap is also referred to as Medicare Supplement insurance and can help you cover most of what Medicare doesnâ€™t. Since Medigap policies are standardized, each plan must provide the same advantages. The main difference will be the premium, which will vary from one company to the next.

                    The optimal time to acquire a Medigap plan is within the first six months after turning 65 and enrolling in both Medicare Parts A and B. In the first six months, the plan cannot require you to undergo a health screening or reject your coverage because of a pre-existing condition.
                  </p>
        
                  <p>
                    If you do not enroll during the first six months known as guaranteed issuance or the Medigap Enrollment Period, you can request a Medigap, but the company is not required to offer you one and may ask you health screening concerns.

                    If you have a pre-existing illness, a medical problem that occurred during three months of the start date of your new Medigap plan, the Medigap insurance company may deny coverage for that illness for three months just after the start date of the Medigap plan, often referred to as a waiting period. If you are substituting a Medigap plan and other more comprehensive insurance that has been in place for at least three months, there is no waiting time for any pre-existing conditions.

                    Medicare Supplement plans do not have a yearly enrollment period. If you're registered in a Medigap plan, you can apply to anyone at any time to buy or switch insurance.

                  <p>Only standardized Medigap plans can be sold by insurers. These strategies must adhere to federal and state regulations. A Medicare supplement policy must also clearly identify itself as Medicare Supplement Insurance across the front.</p>
