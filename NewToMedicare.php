    <p class="text-center">In a nutshell, Original Medicare is a federally financed health care program for anyone 65 and older or who meet other criteria as well as younger people with qualifying illness or disability. Its coverage is critical in controlling medical costs as you get older. However, Medicare payments do not cover all expenses.</p>

        <h6 class="text-center">Original Medicare is divided into two parts: Parts A and B.</h6>

        <h2 class="text-center fw-bolder " style="color:#4f1a52;">What Is the Primary Difference Between Medicare Plans L and K?</h2>
        <p class="text-center">The most important difference between Medigap Plans K and L is that Plan L pays a much higher proportion of insured costs and has a smaller out-of-pocket limit than Plan K. All plans are comparable in that they'll be the only two Medigap policies that do not cover all approved out-of-pocket payments. Moreover, Plan L provides slightly more coverage and usually has a higher monthly payment than Medigap Plan K. It is probably better suited for someone with mild health issues who live in states where excess charges are prohibited. </p>

                    Medicare Advantage is an additional health insurance plan for Medicare beneficiaries. In our state, Medicare Advantage plans (HMOs, PPOs, SNPs, and/or PFFS) are accessible and give full Medicare Part A and Part B advantages, as well as some additional perks. Members may be forced to use a recommended network of providers or groups. Check with your doctors to determine if they take the insurance policy you're thinking about getting. All plans available may not be accessible in your county of residence. If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage, you remain in the Medicare Program but receive your Medicare benefits through a commercial carrier rather than Original Medicare. From October 15 to December 7, you can enroll in a MA  during your Initial Enrollment Period or even during the Open Enrollment Period for Medicare Advantage and  Part D.

All new Beneficiaries have a seven-month window to enroll in a PDP  three months prior, one month during, and three months after their Medicare coverage begins. The PDP's effective date is affected by the month in which you enroll. Everyone with Medicare is eligible to enroll in a PDP; nevertheless, unless you are new to Medicare or are qualified for a Special Enrollment Period, you should enroll or switch providers during the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D Open Enrollment Period, which runs from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7. These program come with a monthly fee. If you have a low income and few assets or resources, you can get help paying your premiums, deductibles, and co-payments.
