    <p class="text-center">Medicare Supplement Plan D, generally recognized as a Medigap plan, is a Medicare Supplement plan. Plan D is one of the ten standardized Medicare Supplement plans that are offered in the majority of states: A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N. These plans, however, are not like the Medicare Part D, which provides prescription medication coverage. Prescription drugs are not covered by Medicare Supplement Plan D. Plan D falls between the most basic and most extensive plans. This plan pays several of the out-of-pocket costs associated with Original Medicare, but just not the Part B deductible or extra charges.</p>
